        <div class="process-container">

    <div class="process-step">
    <img src="../images/project/LIST-it/listit(8).png" alt="process" />
      <p> I began by building the basic front-end using HTML to establish the initial layout of the webpage. This involved creating the necessary HTML elements and structure to define the overall structure and arrangement of the content on the page</p>
    </div>


<h3><u>Followed with</u></h3>

 <div class="process-step">

<p> Afterwards, I added styles using CSS to enhance the visual appearance of the application. The styles were carefully designed to improve the user interface and create an appealing visual experience. Additionally, I incorporated JavaScript to introduce functionality and enhance the overall user experience. The JavaScript code allowed for dynamic interactions and smoother interactions, resulting in a more seamless and enjoyable user experience. </p>

</div>
<h3><u>Then I</u></h3>

 <div class="process-step">

<p> I implemented the backend functionality using Python with Django. By doing so, the lists I created now persist even after closing the local server. This ensures that the data remains saved and accessible whenever the server is restarted or the application is reopened</p>
</div>

<h3><u>Challenges</u></h3>

 <div class="process-step">
<img src="../images/project/LIST-it/listit(9).png" alt="process" />
<p>The struggles I faced were minor, one of them being the styling. The colors I initially picked did not work well together, and the font choice made the text either unclear or harsh on the eyes. The main issue was with the background color, which frustrated me. However, I decided to take a step back, grab a cup of coffee, and reconsider my color scheme for a successful outcome. I opted for a light and dark combination, with subtle hints of color instead of overwhelming the design with excessive colors</p>


<p> Another frustration was adding the static files to the Python Django framework. I prefer separating my JavaScript (JS) and CSS files from my HTML files using folders. This meant that I had to make the necessary changes in views.py, settings.py, and urls.py to ensure a successful setup </p>
