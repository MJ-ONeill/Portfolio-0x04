 <h3> My motivation for creating PrideConnections..</h3>
    <div class="process-step">
      <img src="../images/project/prideconnections/prideconnections(12).png" alt="Step 1">
      <p>I Decided to make a LGBTQ events web app for the LGBTQ community to have a space to share and find events close to them in one place. <br />
      It's important to me because I am also part of that community and Know first hand how difficult it is to find Pride events happening in and around my town, And sharing a event on social media does not reach as much people as we would liike to think, <br />
      
      Example like the the pride weekend even the Pride parade/walk that was happenning in June 2023 was shared all over social media like Facebook, Whatsapp, Insta etc yet still was ther some poeple who did not know about the events happening that weekend and some of those who knew did not really know when and where exactly especially since our own only recently started celebrating Pride month and LGBTQ related events.</p>

  <h3> Started with.. </h3>
    <div class="process-step">
      <img src="../images/project/prideconnections/prideconnections(7).png" alt="Step 1">
      <p>I started developing as usual with the front-end by beggining with HTML to build the layout of the web aplication, I then added JavaScript for the searchand share events functions then added the styles with CSS.</p>
    </div>

    <h3> I then.. </h3>
    <div class="process-step">
      <img src="../images/project/prideconnections/prideconnections(6).png" alt="Step 2">
      <p>For the back-end I am using Python with Django and the database to safe the shared event's to be accesable to whoever search events in their location (It is still a work in progress) </p>
    </div>

    <h3> Challenges I faced... </h3>
    <div class="process-step">
      <img src="../images/project/prideconnections/prideconnections(11).png" alt="Step 2">
      <p>THe challenging part was doing this entire project by myself from coming up with the idea to bringing it to digital life, <br />
      
      I also had challenges with implementing the database as I did not have much DataBase experience at the time,
      <br />
      I  also faced challenges with the styling  because I wanted to incoporate the LGBTQ rainbow colors but getting it all to be visually pleasing and clear presented abit m,ore challlenging than it did in my head, I also did not want to make the flood of colors cause irritation or straign on the users eyes. Work In Progress.
