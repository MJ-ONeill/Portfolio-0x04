        <!--ABOUT-->
  <section id="about" style="font-weight:900;">
    <h2 style="color: black;"><u>About Me</u></h2>
    <p>Coding is not just a trend or a means to a good payday for me; it's my genuine passion. From the very beginning, I fell in love with the entire process of development, from meticulous planning to the sometimes frustrating world of debugging. That incredible feeling after a successful release and even the moments of stress in between, they all contribute to my unwavering enthusiasm for this wonderful world of coding.
<br /><br />
My journey in the realm of programming began in my early years when MS-DOS was still prevalent. Since then, my love for coding has only grown stronger. I approach each day with an eagerness to expand my knowledge and keep up with the latest technologies and programming languages. Challenging myself to learn new processes and languages has become a way of life.
<br /><br />
I dive deep into studying all available data to understand how these technologies and languages work, and then I embark on self-driven projects to put my knowledge into practice. Building applications and web pages allows me to implement what I've learned, ensuring that I can make things work correctly and efficiently. This constant pursuit of learning keeps me on my toes and fuels my desire to improve continuously.
<br /><br />
I firmly believe that you are never too old to learn, and there is no limit to how much knowledge one can acquire. Fortunately, I have a natural ability to grasp new concepts quickly, which helps me stay at the forefront of technological advancements.
<br /><br />
Coding is more than a profession to me; it's a way of life. I embrace the challenges it presents, the constant learning it demands, and the immense satisfaction it brings. I look forward to sharing my passion and expertise with you, as we explore the incredible possibilities that lie within the world of coding.
<br />
Let's embark on this exciting journey together and create amazing things.
